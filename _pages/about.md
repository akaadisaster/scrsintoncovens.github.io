My name is Sophie Sinton-Covens, I am an Information Science student and a Videogaming and Esports student. I have an Associate in Science, a 3.81 GPA, am in the Disclipinary Honors program,  Vice President of the UNCG Minecraft club, and a dedicated member of the community. This website is not just an assignment for IST 436, but also a first look at the person I am, and the person I aspire to be.
